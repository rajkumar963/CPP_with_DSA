"Ese Kr Kr Ke I collected points and crafted the flow of the Correct way to Execute the Points "Right Approach" To Solve the Problem and Improve Your Skills 👇"

I personally follow this approach, and many students and professionals also follow for better improvement. So, if you follow, then you'll definitely find a better result. Otherwise, you're already smart 👀

The right way to improve your problem-solving, and you learn a lot if you try this...

1. 📖 Read the Problem Statement Carefully and try to Understand with Example.

2. After reading and Understanding the Problem Statement, try to Solve the Problem but...

	1. 🔄 Try to identify the Pattern and link the concept that is relatable to a problem you already solved or learned the concept (this way to build the connection between the problem and the concept you already learned in the past).

    2. 🧠 If you find Something, then try to solve it.

    3. 🚀 Otherwise, try to go with a brute-force approach and try to solve.

    4. ⏰ 30 to 45 min is enough for any problem; no need to put in more time if you are not able to solve the problem.

    5. Now here Starts the Main Game .......

	6. 🎥 Watch the Editorial, not the Solution

	( Because Sometimes we do not understand the problem correctly then we try the wrong approach) 🤔

    Example:

    1. 📝 Problem Statement is "Write the Program for the addition of 2 Numbers," and we Understand 

      "Write the Program for subtraction of 2 Numbers" so here we read the problem incorrectly.

    2. After watching the Problem Editorial identify-> you read the Problem the correct way or not

    3. If you understand or read the Problem in the correct way as I explain in Point1.

    4. 🤔 Then try to solve the problem and take 10 more min "Because right now you are reading and Understanding the Problem in Correct Way" 💡

3. After watching the Editorial if again you are not able to solve the problem within 10 min then you go with the "Solution" 🚨

4. But Remember Don't Write the Code watching the Solution 

	1. First, you watch the Entire Video or Article of the Particular Solution.

	2. Complete the Solution video or article and close then 

    3. 📝 Take your Copy and pen take some test cases try to dry run for better understanding.

	4. After Dry Run Code it and Submit 📤

Now Here Starts the Main thing that Improves your Problem-Solving Skills. "If You Follow"

1. After all the Processes that I Explain to you.

2. 🖊️ Take the pen and paper not copy not note down your today Mistake you do during solving the Particular Problem

	Example:

	1. 1st Mistake You did not read the Problem Statement in the Correct Way 📚

	2. 2nd Mistake you were not able to Implement the Concept by your own after watching the video or Solution.

	3. Note these 2 Points and end "Today Take Complete -> Ab Mja Kro" 🎉

3. Tomorrow Again Follow the Same all process "But today you try and focused on those mistakes that you did yesterday so your task is to do not repeat these same mistakes today again" and follow the same process.

4. Obviously, today again, you'll do some mistakes again Write down your mistake. 📝

Now the question is Why I'm focusing on Writing down your mistakes

Here are the Answers:-

1. After Following the approach for 1 week or 10 days 📅

2. and if you see carefully your all the 10 days mistake paper then "You see the Big pattern of the Mistake that you did

again and again on a repetitive way" 🔄

3. Just take your mistake and start working on that.. 💪

Example:

1. You see 60% of mistakes that you do in the Implementation Part which means you are weak on the Implementation 

so just start reversing your concept and start solving more and more problems and Implementing the Algorithm and Data Structure.

2. After Following this Approach 2 or 3 months later you see your Problem-Solving Skill and thinking approach also 🌟

There is the Starting Rules and Steps that I follow "and if you follow then the Result will be better no doubt" 🌟 <br>
